## Testing Web Applications

Testing web applications doesn't have to be painful. Join us for this workshop to get some hands-on experience with Cypress, an end-to-end framework that tests any app that has a user interface.

## By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

1. Install and configure cypress tests from scratch
1. Write at least 3 cypress assertions
1. Stretch: Test user input with cypress actions
